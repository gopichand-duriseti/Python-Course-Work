I was excited to try the Masala Dosa here, but honestly, it was a letdown. The dosa was soggy instead of crisp, and the potato filling lacked flavor. 
It tasted bland and under-seasoned. The chutney also didn’t feel fresh, and the sambar was more watery than flavorful. For the price, I expected much better quality and authentic taste. 
Maybe it was just an off day for the kitchen, but this wasn’t close to the dosa I know and love. 
Definitely room for improvement.
