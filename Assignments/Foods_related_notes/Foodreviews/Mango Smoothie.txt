I ordered the Mango Smoothie hoping for something refreshing, but it was disappointing. Instead of a fresh mango flavor, it tasted artificial, almost like they used syrup or essence instead of real fruit. 
The texture was too watery, and it lacked the creamy richness I was expecting. To make it worse, it was served warm instead of chilled, which completely ruined the experience on a hot day. 
For the price, it didn’t feel worth it at all. 
I wouldn’t recommend this one.
