I ordered the Spicy Veggie Pasta here and I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful it was. The pasta was cooked perfectly – not too soft, not too hard. 
The vegetables added a nice crunch and the seasoning had just the right amount of spice. I especially loved the garlic and chili flakes, which gave it a nice kick without being overwhelming. 
The portion size could have been a little bigger for the price, but overall, it was satisfying. 
The presentation was simple but colorful, and it felt like a healthy yet filling option. Definitely something I’d come back for on a weekday dinner.
