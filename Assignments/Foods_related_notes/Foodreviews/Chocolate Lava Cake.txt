I tried the Chocolate Lava Cake here, and while some parts were delightful, others were disappointing. 
The cake was warm, soft, and the molten center was delicious, which made the first bite really satisfying. 
It paired well with the ice cream, and the presentation looked appetizing.
But on the downside, the portion was small, the texture felt a bit chewy, and parts of the cake seemed slightly overcooked. 
The plate was messy, the taste leaned a little bland in places, and overall it felt slightly overpriced for what was served. A mix of good and bad, not sure Iâ€™d order it again.
