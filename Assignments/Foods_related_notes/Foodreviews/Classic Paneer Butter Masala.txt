I tried the Paneer Butter Masala at this place and honestly, it tasted just like the one you get at high-end restaurants. The gravy was rich, buttery, and creamy with the perfect balance of tanginess from the tomatoes. The paneer cubes were super soft and fresh, soaking up all the flavors. I paired it with garlic naan, and the combination was amazing. 
The dish was a little on the heavier side, but that’s expected with butter masala. It’s definitely a must-try here if you love North Indian food. One of the best paneer dishes I’ve had in a long time.
